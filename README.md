# VShelf
## Virtual Bookshelf app in Java

This app works as a database for a private book collection, helping you to catalog your books when the 
collection keeps getting bigger and bigger.

It is supposed to be used by multiple users on the same computer, allowing, for example, a family to keep their records together.
The data is saved using Object Streams, since its volume is not big enough for a real database and the app is used offline.

The app functionalities are:
* Create a new user
* Login with existing user
* Add a new book
* Edit/remove a book
* Order book list by title, author, rating, genre, ou read status.
* Search an existing book

What's missing yet?
1. Add search bar to user frame
2. Add images so vshelf.isPretty()==true.

It was built in Java and the UI was made using Swing. I developed VShelf in Netbeans.
